          Socium Services collaborated with B2Gig to engineer a sophisticated
          system, streamlining the connection between customers seeking services
          and the businesses and contractors executing them on-site. Socium
          orchestrated the development of a web-based dashboard tailored for
          businesses using the latest web tech stack such as HTML5, CSS3,
          ReactJs, NodeJs along with its subsidiary libraries such as Redux and
          Express. This intuitive interface empowers businesses to seamlessly
          schedule and manage appointments, while also overseeing their
          workforce, assigning confirmed appointments, and monitoring job
          progress from initiation to completion. Harnessing GPS capabilities
          within employees’ mobile devices, the dashboard ensures real-time
          tracking. Furthermore, Socium seamlessly integrated diverse payment
          gateways—PayPal, Braintree, Venmo, and credit/debit cards—facilitating
          frictionless transactions upon job completion.

              In tandem with the business dashboard, Socium engineered a bespoke

              comprehensive overview of forthcoming appointments with detailed
              specifics for each.

                On-site, employees initiate jobs through the app, activating a

                notes and visual confirmations before marking the task as
                completed, thus concluding the timer. Post-completion, employees
                effortlessly generate invoices based on tracked time, sending
                them via text or email. Multiple payment options, including
                cash, cards, and online methods, facilitate seamless
                transactions.

        Why B2Gig
        </h1>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The integration of Loyalty Program, Workforce Management, and Business
          Analytics into one platform will create a comprehensive
          intra-reporting system, such as allowing for in-depth analysis of
          employee performance based on rewards, sales, and actual hours worked.
          This eliminates the need for employees to switch between multiple
          platforms for various operational tasks, ensuring utmost convenience.
          Moreover, employers can easily manage employee authorizations,
          restricting access to sensitive information within the platform. With
          this unified solution, there is no longer a requirement to engage with
          different companies for distinct operational needs, avoiding separate
          subscription expenses. The system efficiently oversees inventory
          management and employee scheduling, streamlining operations,
          simplifying tasks, and significantly enhancing overall efficiency for
          both employees and employers. As a result, business management becomes
          a seamless and hassle-free experience.
